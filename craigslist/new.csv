http://newyork.craigslist.org/mnh/aiv/5129823027.html,Roommate in Large 2-BR - Normandie Court Lease Assignment MOVE IN NOW!,"$1,390 ","I am looking for someone to take over the remainder of my lease for a large 2-BR converted apartment at Normandie Court (high-rise, doorman building). It is available for move-in starting immediately. The current lease expires at the end of November 2015, but there will be an option to renew it.  The room that is available is the master bedroom (i.e., non-converted room) with plenty of closet space. This room has a large window and can fit a queen bed, nightstand, dresser, and desk with room to spare. 

My current roommate (female in late 20s) will be staying in the converted room at least until the current lease ends. She is super friendly, laidback, very respectful of your space/belongings, quiet, and often out of the apartment.  

Rent for the master bedroom is $1,390/month, with a flexible move-in date. 

Since the lease assignment will be done through building management, they will require:
-	Credit check fee of $75
-	Lease assignment fee of $500

Rent for this entire apartment is $2,680, which is significantly less than other comparably sized rentals at Normandie Court, which are currently going for at least $3,200. [READ: This is a great deal!] 

The living room is fully furnished, and the dresser and desk currently in the master bedroom would also be available for purchase. So in terms of furniture, basically all you would have to bring is a bed/mattress!",1BR,5129823027,2015-07-18 10:08pm,,2015/7/23 20:14,124508071@qq.com,
